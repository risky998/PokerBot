# Poker Game Theory:

### Understanding Sequential Games:
Poker is not a one-shot game, where players simply carry out all actions in one 
turn and simultaneously reveal a hand.

Rather, it is carried out over multiple turns.

### Maximally Exploitative Strategy:
This the most profitable set of actions/responses to an opponent's fixed strategy. 
Of course, in order to develop an MES, one needs to know the full strategy of the
opponent. 

### Counter Exploitation: 
MES is based on the fixed strategy of the opponent, but of course if the opponent 
recognizes this, then they can improve to a new strategy which counters the hero's
MES. 

### Nash Equilibrium/Game Theory Optimal Poker: 
Game theory optimal is the idea that is used to represent Nash Equilibrium's in poker. 
The idea of the Nash Equilibrium is too find a set of stragies which are mutually
optimal against each other. Given this set of strategies, there is no incentive for either 
player to deviate from this strategy. The idea here is that there is no player that
can change their own strategy to improve on their own expectation. 

__MES Equilibrium Strategies__:
Equilibirum Strategies are maximally exploitative when they are played against unexploitable opponents so they get the properties of MES:

- Individual hands are played in the most profitable way possible, GTO never involves playing a hand less profitably than it should be played. 
- Strictly dominated strategies will not be part of the equilibrium as they will never be profitable. 
- The only way a hand can be played in more than one way at the equilibrium is if multiple strategic choices have the same EV. 

### The Indifference Principle: 
The only way a poker hand can be played in two different ways at the equilibirum is if both of the actions that are being played have the same EV. There is an idea of mutual indifference. If a player is indifferent between two options it, must be because their opponent is making them so.
